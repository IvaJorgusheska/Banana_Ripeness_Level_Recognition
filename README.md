# Banana Ripeness Dataset

## Description
This dataset consists of 300 images of bananas, divided into three ripeness levels: unripe, ripe, and rotten, with 100 images for each category. The images were collected and annotated during the process of fine-tuning a machine learning model for object detection and ripeness classification.

## Dataset Structure
- **unripe/**: Contains 100 images of unripe bananas.
- **ripe/**: Contains 100 images of ripe bananas.
- **rotten/**: Contains 100 images of rotten bananas.

## Purpose
The dataset is intended for researchers and practitioners in the field of machine learning, particularly for tasks involving object detection and classification based on ripeness levels. It can be utilized to develop and evaluate models aimed at agricultural applications.

## Usage
To use the dataset, download the images and place them in your project directory. Ensure you preprocess the images according to the requirements of your machine learning model.

## Future Work
This project is ongoing, and I plan to publish the final machine learning model once the training and evaluation processes are completed. Updates will be provided in this repository.
